# MK-filesplits
A quick shell script I made to split files up and rename them and append "print "/ip firewall address-list" at the beginning. I made this because I was working on a very low end MikroTik routerboard.
Use this on a linux machine with Gawk & mmv installed. 
Use in conjunction with https://github.com/pwlgrzs/Mikrotik-Blacklist/blob/master/blacklist.rsc.
